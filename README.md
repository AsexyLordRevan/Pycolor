# Pycolor
A colour sync tool

Pycolor is a small part of the larger project Pysync, coming soon. Pycolor sources colours from a user configured theme, and parses it into CSS, GTK, Rasi, and bash.

You can sync these files to other pieces of software, such as Waybar, GTK, Hyprland, Firefox, Discord, or Rofi, although it's alot easier with Pysync
